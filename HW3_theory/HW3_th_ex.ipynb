    "# Part 1: Classification with K-means algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a fundamental tool among the unsupervised learning model. Consider a problem with a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\left\\{x_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^n$ where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ with no labels, we are aiming at finding some hidden structure within the data, namely, we would like to find clusters in the dataset. Classifiers have been studied in TP but mainly for supervised learning, here the data are not labeled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm tries to classify the dataset in $K$ clusters. Each cluster is represented by a centroid, meaning the average of the points within the cluster. We note $C_k$ the set of points of a cluster $k$ and $\\mu_k$ its centroid. Then, the algorithm minimizes the intra-cluster variance, in other words, it tries to reduce the distance between the points of the cluster and the centroid. \n",
    "\n",
    "More technically, the algorithm works iteratively in two main steps: \n",
    " - Points are assigned to clusters based on their proximity to existing centroid\n",
    " - Centroids are updated by taking the average of the points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Loss function of the problem can be written as:\n",
    "$$J(\\mu_1, ..., \\mu_K) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\, \\lVert x_i - \\mu(i)\\rVert^2 \\; ,$$\n",
    "where $\\mu(i)$ is the centroid of the cluster assignated to $x_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to check the understanding of the choice of this loss function. Does it match the aforementioned rules? Then, could it help to understand if the algorithm converges?\n",

Instead of sampling from the true model distribution, CD-k uses a short Gibbs sampling chain initialized at the data.
